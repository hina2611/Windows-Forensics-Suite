## IOC Format

```json
{
  "hashes": [
    "44d88612fea8a8f36de82e1278abb02f"
  ],
  "paths": [
    "C:\\Users\\Public\\bad.exe"
  ],
  "domains": [
    "example-phish.test"
  ],
  "ips": [
    "203.0.113.10"
  ],

## VirusTotal Integration

Set your API key:

```powershell
$env:VT_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
```

---

## Generated Outputs

After execution the tool generates:

- evidence.json
- report.json
- report.html
- report.pdf

---

## Recommended Workflow

1. Create a new case.
2. Collect host artifacts.
3. Run IOC and YARA analysis.
4. Review suspicious findings.
5. Generate reports.
6. Preserve evidence according to DFIR procedures.
